GitHub is a website that stores Git repositories on the internet to facilitate the collaboration that Git allows for. A repository is simply a place to keep track of code and all the changes to code.

Git commands:
git clone <url> : take a repository stored on a server (like GitHub) and downloads it
git add <filename(s)> : add files to the staging area to be included in the next commit
git commit -m "message" : take a snapshot of the repository and save it with a message about the changes
git commit -am <filename(s)> "message" : add files and commit changes all in one
git status : print what is currently going on with the repository
git push : push any local changes (commits) to a remote server
git pull : pull any remote changes from a remote server to a local computer
git log : print a history of all the commits that have been made
git reflog : print a list of all the different references to commits
git reset --hard <commit> : reset the repository to a given commit
git reset --hard origin/master : reset the repository to its original state (e.g. the version cloned from GitHub)
When combining different versions of code, e.g. using git pull, a merge conflict can occur if the different versions have different data in the same location. Git will try to take care of merging automatically, but if two users edit, for example, the same line, a merge conflict will have to be manually resolved.
To resolve a merge conflict, simply locally remove all lines and code that are not wanted and push the results.
