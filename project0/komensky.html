			<h5 class="jumbotron">John Amos Comenius was a Czech philosopher, pedagogue and theologian from the Margraviate of Moravia and is considered <b>the father of modern education</b>. He served as the last bishop of Unity of the Brethren and became a religious refugee and one of the earliest champions of universal education, a concept eventually set forth in his book Didactica Magna. As an educator and theologian, he led schools and advised governments across Protestant Europe through the middle of the seventeenth century.</h5>

			<p>Comenius was the innovator who first introduced pictorial textbooks, written in native language instead of Latin, applied effective teaching based on the natural gradual growth from simple to more comprehensive concepts, supported lifelong learning and development of logical thinking by moving from dull memorization, presented and <b>supported the idea of equal opportunity for impoverished children, opened doors to education for women, and made instruction universal and practical</b>.</p>
